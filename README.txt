Inspir@tion.
Created by J Dallos.

Inspir@tion is a web application utilizing the Bored API to provide the user with suggestions for activites.
At the most basic level the app is an idea generator with a simple and playful user interface to encourage engagement.
The app also provides a search function to allow the user to specify the parameters of their desired activities.

Future plans for Inspir@tion include CRUD functionality, providing users with a unqiue session and storing their 'liked' activities 
in a database in order to create a 'bucketlist'. Also a recommended search feature will be implemented based upon their 'liked' activities.
